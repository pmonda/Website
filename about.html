    <p class="paragraph">Hi there! My name is Pranesh Monda, and I am a sophomore at Purdue University
        studying Computer Engineering. I am also planning on applying to medical school.
        My passion lies in the intersection between Software Engineering, Artificial
        Intelligence, and Medicine. More specifically, I'm focused on how the power of
        coding, artificial intelligence, and big data can be used to improve quality of
        care for patients. Furthermore,I hope to one day implement systems in a
        healthcare establishment that I operate.
