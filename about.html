    <p class="paragraph">Hi there! My name is Pranesh Monda, and I am a Junior at Purdue University
        studying Computer Engineering. I've been coding since high school and I started with Java and I worked with OOP. I always designed and built rudimentary applications to develop my     experience and hand at solving real-world problems and to get in touch with my ability to make a meaningful impact on the issues the world may face through software engineering. I've also loved training, testing, visualizing, and analyzing real-world data to generate useful predictions that make increasingly accurate models through machine learning in Python. 

At Purdue, I've worked extensively with the C Programming Language learning all kinds of skills ranging from the basics of how the components in computers process logical data all the way to the implementation of data structures and algorithms and everything in between. I've also worked with Verilog as well to provide instructions to more hardware-based systems in courses like Digital System Design and now in the near future with Assembly in Microprocessors.
